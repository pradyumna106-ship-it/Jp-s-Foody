MealMate is a full‑stack food ordering and delivery web application that connects hungry diners with nearby local restaurants. It is designed to offer a smooth, transparent ordering experience for users while helping restaurants accept and manage online orders without paying heavy commissions to third‑party platforms.

## Problem Overview

On a busy or rainy day, many people want restaurant‑quality food without stepping outside. At the same time, restaurants often face empty tables during off‑peak hours and would love to serve more customers. Traditional food delivery platforms bridge this gap, but they often:

- Charge high commissions on every order, cutting deeply into restaurant profits.  
- Offer unclear menus and limited information for customers.  
- Provide inconsistent order tracking and sometimes steep delivery charges.

These issues create friction for both diners and restaurant owners. MealMate aims to simplify this process and make it fair for everyone involved.

## What Is MealMate?

MealMate is a Python/Django‑based web application that brings diners and local eateries closer together. Users can browse restaurants, explore clear and structured menus, place online orders, and track them in real time. Restaurant owners get a dedicated dashboard to receive, manage, and update orders without relying on expensive third‑party delivery aggregators.

The focus is on:

- A clean, intuitive customer experience.  
- Empowering restaurant partners with better control over their online orders.  
- Reducing platform overheads so small eateries can stay profitable.
